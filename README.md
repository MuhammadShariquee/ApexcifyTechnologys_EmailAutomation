# ApexcifyTechnologys_EmailAutomation

## 📌 Project Overview
This repository contains my **Task 2 – Email Automation System** completed as part of the **Python Programming Internship** at **Apexcify Technologys**.  

The goal of this project is to create a Python program that automatically sends a single message to multiple recipients using **SMTP** and Python’s built-in **email libraries**.

---

## 🎯 What the Program Does
- Connects to Gmail’s SMTP server.  
- Logs in using the sender’s email and app password.  
- Sends a formatted HTML email to multiple recipients (20+).  
- Prints confirmation for each successful delivery.  
- Demonstrates how Python can be used to automate repetitive communication tasks.

## 💡 My Experience
This was my **first ever automation project**, and honestly, it was a tough one for me.  
I had never worked on automation before, so at first I fumbled a lot — made mistakes, fixed them, and retried multiple times.  

But in the end, I managed to handle it and produced the **desired output** successfully. ✅  

Through this task, I gained **hands-on experience with automation** and explored important Python libraries like `smtplib` and `email.mime`.  
It was a real confidence booster and gave me practical insight into how automation can make everyday tasks efficient. 🚀
